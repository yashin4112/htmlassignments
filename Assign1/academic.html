            As the students grow a little older and their understanding of the world around them
            increases, their subject base increases; the curriculum needs to evolve to keep pace with
            the developing skill set.<br>

            Conversation around topics like tolerance towards all races, religions and ways of life
            builds the normal character of the child in thses years. The school aims at encouraging these
            young minds to relate positively with others and take responsibility for their own actions<br>.
            The academic knowledge helps complete the goal of supporting the development of a well-balanced
